        Remember that the title element gives search engines extra information about the page.
        It also displays the content of that title element in two more ways:
          in the title bar when the page is open
          in the browser tab for the page when you hover on it. Even if that tab is not active,
          once you hover on the tab, the title text is displayed.

          Within the head element, nest a title element with the text Colored Markers.
