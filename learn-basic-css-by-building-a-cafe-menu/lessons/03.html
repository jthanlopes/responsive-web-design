    Step 3
      The title is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web
      page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.

      Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset set to the
      value utf-8 to tell the browser how to encode characters for the page. Note that meta
      elements are self-closing.
