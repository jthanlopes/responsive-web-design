      Step 11
        The next position property is absolute. When you use the absolute value for your position
        property, the element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, and then its position
        is determined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

        Set the position property of your .cat-head element to absolute, then set top and left
        properties to any pixel value.
