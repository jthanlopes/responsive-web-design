  <!--
    Step 14
      You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since
      there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and
      link to it.

      We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that
      file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.

      Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to
      exclude the opening and closing style tags.
