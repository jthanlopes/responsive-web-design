      Step 15
        The last position property value is sticky. sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and
        fixed positioning. It allows an element to stick to a specific position within its containing
        element or viewport, based on the scroll position.

        Change the value of the position property of .cat-head to sticky, set top to 0, then remove
        left and its value.

        Note: To see how sticky works, you have to place a couple of texts before and after your
        .cat-head div element. If you scroll up after that, you'll see that the .cat-head gets stuck
        to the top and remains there.
