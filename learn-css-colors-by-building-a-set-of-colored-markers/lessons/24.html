      Step 24
        While the red and blue markers look the same, the green one is much lighter than it
        was before. This is because the green color keyword is actually a darker shade, and is
        about halfway between black and the maximum value for green.

        In the .two CSS rule, set the green value in the rgb function to 127 to lower its
        intensity.
