    <!--
      Step 32
        Notice that, to create orange, you had to increase the intensity of red and decrease
        the intensity of the green rgb values. This is because orange is the combination of
        red and yellow, and falls between the two colors on the color wheel.

        To create the tertiary color spring green, combine cyan with green. Update the rgb
        function in the .two CSS rule so that green is at the max value, and set blue to 127.
