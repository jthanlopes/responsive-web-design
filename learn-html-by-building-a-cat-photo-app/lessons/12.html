  <!--
    Step 12
      In the previous step you turned the words link to cat pictures into a link by placing them
      between opening and closing anchor (a) tags. You can do the same to words inside of an element,
      such as a p element.

      In the text of your p element, turn the words cat photos into a link to
      https://freecatphotoapp.com by adding opening and closing anchor (a) tags around these words.
