      Step 8
        Time for CSS.
        Even though your <div> has no text, it's still treated as a box with content. Write a CSS rule
          that uses the .canvas class selector and set its width to 500 pixels. Here's a CSS rule that
          sets the width of the class card to 300 pixels:

        .card {
          width: 300px;
        }
