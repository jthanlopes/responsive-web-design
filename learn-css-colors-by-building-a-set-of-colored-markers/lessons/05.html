      Step 5
        You can have multiple self-closing meta elements on a web page. What distinguishes one
        meta element from the other is the attribute. You should add a new meta element for each
        attribute you want to specify.

        Add another self-closing meta element within the head. Give it a name attribute set to
        viewport and a content attribute set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 so your
        page looks the same on all devices.
