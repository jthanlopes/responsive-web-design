    Step 6
      In the previous step, you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element.
      This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the
      element they are nested in.
      This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

      The h1 element, h2 element and the comment are indented two spaces more than the main element
      in the code below. Use the space bar on your keyboard to add two more spaces in front of
      the p element so that it is indented properly as well.
