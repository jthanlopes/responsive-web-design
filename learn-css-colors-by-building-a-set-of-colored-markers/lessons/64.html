    <!--
      Step 64
        Even without the color-stops, you might have noticed that the colors for the green marker transition at
        the same points as the red marker. The first color is at the start (0%), the second is in the middle
        (50%), and the last is at the end (100%) of the gradient line.

        The linear-gradient function automatically calculates these values for you, and places colors evenly
        along the gradient line by default.

        In the .red CSS rule, remove the three color stops from the linear-gradient function to clean up your
        code a bit.
