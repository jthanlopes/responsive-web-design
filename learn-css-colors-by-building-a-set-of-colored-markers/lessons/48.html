      Step 48
        The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent
        colors.

        The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage
        from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

        If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees,
        and blue is at 240 degrees.

        Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.
        You must add the percent sign % to the saturation and lightness values.

        Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete
        white, with 50% being neutral.

        In the .blue CSS rule, use the hsl function to change the background-color property to
        pure blue. Set the hue to 240, the saturation to 100%, and the lightness to 50%.
