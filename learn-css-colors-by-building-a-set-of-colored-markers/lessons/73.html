      Step 73
        Opacity describes how opaque, or non-transparent, something is. For example, a solid wall is opaque, and
        no light can pass through. But a drinking glass is much more transparent, and you can see through the
        glass to the other side.

        With the CSS opacity property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is. With the value
        0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%, the element will be completely
        opaque like it is by default.

        In the .sleeve CSS rule, set the opacity property to 0.5.
