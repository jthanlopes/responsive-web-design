      Step 36
        A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and
        different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and
        orange.

        Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary
        colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are
        placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

        In the rgb function for the .one CSS rule, set the red value to the max of 255 to
        produce pure red. In the rgb function for .two CSS rule, set the values for green and
        blue to the max of 255 to produce cyan.
