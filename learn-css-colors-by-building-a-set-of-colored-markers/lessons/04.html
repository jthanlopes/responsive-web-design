      Step 4
        To tell browsers how to encode characters on your page, set the charset to utf-8.
        utf-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character from all human
        languages.

        Inside the head element, nest a meta element with the attribute charset set to utf-8.
        Remember that meta elements are self-closing, and do not need a closing tag.
