      Step 4
        Screen readers announce HTML elements based on the document flow. We
        will eventually want the balance sheet to have a heading of "Balance Sheet"
        and a subheading of "AcmeWidgetCorp". However, this order does not make
        sense if announced by a screen reader.

        Give your existing span the class attribute set to flex, and add two span
        elements within it. Give the first the text AcmeWidgetCorp. Give the second
        the text Balance Sheet. You will use CSS to reverse the order of the text on
        the page, but the HTML order will make more sense for a screen reader.
