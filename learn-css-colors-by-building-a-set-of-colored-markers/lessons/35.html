      Step 35
        Now that you've gone through all the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors on a color
        wheel, it'll be easier to understand other color theory concepts and how they impact
        design.

        First, in the CSS rules .one, .two, and .three, adjust the values in the rgb function
        so that the background-color of each element is set to pure black. Remember that the
        rgb function uses the additive color model, where colors start as black and change as
        the values of red, green, and blue increase.
