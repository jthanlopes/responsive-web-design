    <!--
      Step 49
        You've learned a few ways to set flat colors in CSS, but you can also use a color
        transition, or gradient, on an element.

        A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function
        lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are
        used.

        One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image
        element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image
        as a value.

        In the .red CSS rule, change the background-color property to background.
