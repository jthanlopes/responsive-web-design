      Step 10
        Now that you have reset the html box model, you need to pass that on to the elements within as
        well. To do this, you can set the box-sizing property to inherit, which will tell the targeted
        elements to use the same value as the parent element.

        You will also need to target the pseudo-elements, which are special keywords that follow a
        selector. The two pseudo-elements you will be using are the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.

        The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element,
        while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected
        element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see
        later in this project.

        For now, create a CSS selector to target all elements with *, and include the pseudo-elements
        with ::before and ::after. Set the box-sizing property to inherit.
