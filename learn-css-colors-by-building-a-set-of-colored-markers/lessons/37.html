      Step 37
        Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright right next to each other. This
        contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to
        read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.

        It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its
        complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

        First, in the h1 rule, use the rgb function to set its background-color to cyan.
