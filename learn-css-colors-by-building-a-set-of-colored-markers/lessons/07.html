      Step 7
        In this project you'll work with an external CSS file to style the page. We've already
        created a styles.css file for you. But before you can use it, you'll need to link it to
        the page.

        Nest a link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute set to stylesheet
        and an href attribute set to styles.css.
